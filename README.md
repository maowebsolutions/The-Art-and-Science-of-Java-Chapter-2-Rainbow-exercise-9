Exercise fromt the book The Art and Science of Java

/* Create a rainbow with
* red , orange, yellow, green,
* blue, and magenta, respectively
* and cyan makes a lovely color for the sky
*/

Starting at the top. the six stripes in the rainbow arc red , orange, yellow, green,
blue, and magenta, respectively; cyan makes a lovely color for the sky.
At first glance, it might seem as if this problem requires you to draw arcs .
As it turns out , you can create the stripes in the rainbow using onl y circles,
although seeing how th is is possible forces you to think outside the box- in a
literal as well as a fig urative sense. The common center for each circle is some
di stance below the bottom of the window, and the diameters of the circles are
wider than the screen. The GraphicsProgram shows only the part of the figure
that actually appears in the window. This process of reducing a pic ture to the
visi ble area is called clipping.
